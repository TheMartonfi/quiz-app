Carl: Getting more familliar with using bootstrap
Jayden: Getting the app to look good on mobile

— What you learned and/or what you’ll do differently in final projects
Carl: 
Using AJAX to make requests to get info from the DB instead of relying on EJS
(Allows for more dynamic experiences on a single page)
TLDR: Use client side rendering instead of server side rendering

Learned a lot about using express routes
(Got more familiar with using routes and how useful they can be)
