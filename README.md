# Quiz App Project

Quiz App is a full stack web application that allows you to make quizzes and play quizzes and share your results with friends. Results include statistics like average time to complete a quiz and average score for each quiz. You can also give a rating to quizzes and quizzes are sorted by rating on the home page. You can also search for specific quizzes if you find there's too many options to choose from!
